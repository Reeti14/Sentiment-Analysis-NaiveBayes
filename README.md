# Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews using Naive Bayes

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on product reviews to determine whether a review is **positive or negative**. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and the **Naive Bayes** classification algorithm.

---

## Project Description

The main goal of this project is to analyze product reviews from a dataset and classify them based on sentiment. The classifier is trained to understand the difference between positive and negative reviews using real-world review data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `nltk` for text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
  - `scikit-learn` for model training and evaluation

- **Steps Followed**:
  1. **Loading the dataset** of product reviews.
  2. **Preprocessing the text**: removing stopwords, stemming, tokenizing.
  3. **Feature Extraction** using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
  4. **Model Training** using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
  5. **Evaluation**: Using accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.

| **Handling large datasets**        | Filtered to a smaller subset for faster testing and reduced memory usage       |
| **Noisy, unstructured review text**| Applied NLTK preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming       |
| **Model overfitting on training set** | Tuned TF-IDF parameters and used Naive Bayes for simplicity and generalization |
